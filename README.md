# Greatest Common Denominator Algorithm in Assembly

## About

The algorithm, written in x86 Assembly, takes two numbers as input and prints the greatest common denominator. It uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to implement functionality.

## Versioning

**VERSION:** 1.0

**RELEASE:** N/A

**LAST UPDATED:** April 27th, 2018

## Resources

**gcd.asm:** Written implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the greatest common denominator.

**Makefile:** Makefile for building and running the source file.

## How To Use

The system requires nasm to run.

To use the system:
1. Run `make` to compile the source.
2. Run `make run` to run the code. It will ask for input in the terminal.
3. Run `make clean` to clean up all object files and executables in the directory.

## Future Development

No future development is planned at this time.
